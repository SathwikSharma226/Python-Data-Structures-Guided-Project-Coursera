# Python-Data-Structures-Guided-Project-Coursera
Data structures play a crucial role in application development. The proper selection of data structures is important for efficient algorithm development. The availability of a list, for example, greatly simplifies sorting a collection of data items.  It would be difficult to do this without that data structure, as you will see. This is why Programming languages like Python have certain fundamental data structures built into the language.

In this course, you will create a Python application that reads from a file containing words and their definitions. You will use Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures to make a multiple choice quiz based on words and their definitions.
